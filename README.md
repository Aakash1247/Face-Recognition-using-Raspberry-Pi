## What's Raspberry pi?
> Raspberry pi is a mini computer(credit card sized), which is capable of doing various tasks but with less computation power as it doesn't have powerful resources. The Raspberry Pi is slower than a modern laptop or desktop but is still a complete Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities that implies, at a low-power consumption level.

## what is Face Recognition?
> Face Recognition/Facial Recognition is a category of biometric software which identifies people by their faces. Face is captured by digital camera and the system is trained and then it is capable of identifying the person.

## OpenCV Library
> OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android.
